                The goal of this work was to try and highlight the potential “Empowering Effect” discussed in the introduction. The two comparisons made on both pairs of data sets have not provided results that indicate clearly such an effect. If some light indications of an empowering effect could perhaps be distinguished in the monthly mean analysis, particularly when considering the first intervention, these indications could not be confirmed when performing the linear regressions. Indeed, The 'Common' set features large confidence intervals that drown the data in uncertainty and the scientific articles comparison yielded no significant result whatsoever. The only effect (short term) that could possibly be observed for the last intervention when comparing the common articles in the monthly mean analysis is not supported by any other result (apart from the daily pageviews of the single 'Global Warming' article) and therefore seems to be an artefact introduced by the noise on the set of popular articles.

                This particular analysis did not demonstrate any “Empowering Effect”. However, this should in no case undermine the message conveyed by Miss Thunberg in her attempt to change minds. There is still hope to be had, the night is young, maybe almost as young as Greta herself.
