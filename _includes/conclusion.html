                The goal of this work was to try and highlight the potential “Empowering Effect” discussed in the introduction. The two comparisons made on both pairs of data sets have not provided results that indicate clearly such an effect. If some light indications of an empowering effect could be distinguished in the monthly mean analysis, particularly when considering the first intervention, these indications could not be confirmed when performing the linear regressions. Indeed, the scientific articles comparison yielded no significant result whatsoever. The only effect (short term) that could possibly be observed for the last intervention when comparing the common articles is not supported by any other result and therefore seems to be an artefact here.

                To conclude, the event taken were too close to each other to distinguish a potential trend and so it is not possible to determine wether Greta Tunberg has an impact on general population research on Wikipedia.
