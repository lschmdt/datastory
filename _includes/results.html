                To verify the claim of an "Empowering effect", we will use the immediate change in pageviews from before to after each event, as well as the long term trend indicated by the regression slopes and levels. The potential trends observed in the treatment group will be compared to the data in the comparator group. To verify the statistical significance of those results, the confidence intervals of the regressions are taken into consideration.

                        First, it is noted that the climate articles have a steady increase of monthly mean number of pageviews across the 3 events. This seems to be consistent with an “Empowering Effect” already before comparison with the control group. Compared with the control group, we observe that only the first (+12% for treatment,  -34% for control) and third (+14% for treatment, -40% for control) interruptions lead to a more positive difference of monthly mean number of pageviews for the treatment group, whereas the comparison of both sets for the second interruption (+2% for treatment, +59% for control) shows a radically more positive difference for the control group.

                      A comparison of the mean number of pageviews per month for each period is performed. The monthly mean is increased by about 2 % between period 1 and 2 for the treatment group whereas the monthly mean for the control is reduced by approximately 4.5 %. This doesn’t seem to be repeated for the second interruption, where the drop for both sets is comparable (approximately 10.5 %), even though a bit smaller for the climate change related set (more like 10.2 %). The trend is not verified either for the third interruption where the drop for the treatment is group 7.2 % but the drop for the control group is 4.3 %.

                The steady increase of the treatment group when the other group has radical differences between periods is consistent with an "Empowering Effect" at least for the first and last interruptions. The control group has a large variance, which seems to make the comparison a bit fragile here.

                Intuitively, if the claim of an "Empowering Effect" is true, the monthly mean number of pageviews across the 4 periods should increase more/decrease less in the treatment group (articles related to climate change) than in the control. This sort of trend is not observable for the scientific articles, at least not for the 2nd and 3rd interventions. One might argue that the first intervention might have had an impact. This claim is to be verified by further tests.

                        The comparison between the linear regression on the popular articles and the one on the climate change related articles doesn’t seem to indicate clearly an "Empowering Effect". The long term effect is basically non-existent, indeed the slope of the number of views for both corpus is close to zero in the last period. A short term effect might possibly be argued at the last interruption, since a positive jump is observed in the number of pageviews of the climate change related articles and a negative jump is observed in the corpus featuring the popular articles. The strong negative jump in the corpus featuring the popular articles at the first interruption is also observable but can easily be attributed to noise, which is omnipresent on this set.
                        We can see that the popular articles dataset is quite noisy from the R-squared value. Indeed, the optimal linear regression has R-squared equal to 0.499. The fit does not explain a large amount of the set’s variance.

                        The linear regressions and their confidence intervals overlap heavily especially in the first and last periods. It is a good thing that they overlap in the first period because it means that both corpus are similar enough before the treatment appears. That they overlap so much in the last period would be consistent with the claim that there was no long term "Empowering Effect" in this case.

                        No immediate change can be observed at the interruptions. The confidence intervals overlap quite a bit and it is difficult to assess a long term effect.

                        It is worth noting here that the R-squared value of both linear regressions are similar, suggesting that the quality of the fits is comparable. This is also due to the fact that the variance in both sets is comparable.
