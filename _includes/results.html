                    To verify the claim of an "Empowering effect", we use the immediate change in pageviews from before to after each event, as well as the long term trend indicated by the regression slopes and levels. The potential trends observed in the treatment group is compared to the data in the comparator group. To verify the statistical significance of those results, the confidence intervals of the regressions are taken into consideration.

                It is important to control if our dataset does contain outliers. If it is the case, they need to be removed, in order to keep the dataset as meaningful as possible. To do so, the first thing to do is to use the Cook's D values from the regression of each dataset to detect the presence of potential outliers. As some are observed, it is then decided to use the z-score to find the article that created this effect. This technique is used, in order to reproduce the method followed by J. Penney. Whether an article has a z-score superior to 3.0 or inferior to -3.0, it might be considered as an outlier. For the first study case, in the climate related group, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change">"Global warming"</a> is apparently a large outlier, unfortunately, this is the main article related to our problematic, it has been decided to keep it in the dataset since it is very relevant. Concerning the second study case, we can consider that the outliers for the climate change dataset are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health">"Health"</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy">"Life expectancy"</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism">"Humanism"</a>, it is logical since these themes are linked to other matter that only the climate change. For the control dataset about scientific articles, we can see the Galileo Galilei and Autism are outliers. We can drop them in the aggregate.

                On the image below, the Global warming outlier is plotted for the whole period, considering the interruptions to see if it is consistent with an "Empowering Effect". Here, the pageviews are averaged over 7 days to filter out the weekly pattern.

                It seems like the first interruption doesn't lead to a direct increase in pageviews, even though they appear a bit later. The second interruption, if anything, leads to a sudden and sharp drop that is not consistent with an "Empowering Effect''. Only the third interruption leads to an increase of the pageviews which would be consistent with an "Empowering Effect".

            <p>
                To start the analysis, monthly means were performed as first results. A more positive change of the monthly mean number of pageviews for the Climate change articles as compared to the control articles would be consistent with an "Empowering Effect".

                            Here, it is noted that the climate articles have a steady increase of monthly mean number of pageviews across the 3 events. This seems to be consistent with an “Empowering Effect” already before comparison with the control group. Compared with the control group, we observe that only the first (+12% for treatment, -34% for control) and third (+14% for treatment, -40% for control) interruptions lead to a more positive difference of monthly mean number of pageviews for the treatment group, whereas the comparison of both sets for the second interruption (+2% for treatment, +59% for control) shows a radically more positive difference for the control group.

                        Here it is observed that, the monthly mean is decreased by about 2 % between period 1 and 2 for the treatment group whereas the monthly mean for the control is reduced by approximately 4.5 %. This doesn’t seem to be repeated for the second interruption, where the drop for both sets is comparable (approximately 10.5 %), even though a bit smaller for the climate change related set (more like 10.2 %). The trend is not verified either for the third interruption where the drop for the treatment is group 7.2 % but the drop for the control group is 4.3 %.

                The steady increase of the treatment group when the other group has radical differences between periods is consistent with an "Empowering Effect" at least for the first and last interruptions. The control group has a large variance, which seems to make the comparison a bit fragile here. Intuitively, if the claim of an "Empowering Effect" is true, the monthly mean number of pageviews across the 4 periods should increase more/decrease less in the treatment group (articles related to climate change) than in the control. This sort of trend is not observable for the scientific articles, at least not for the 2nd and 3rd interventions. One might argue that the first intervention might have had an impact. This claim is to be verified by further tests.

            <p>
                Finally, a linear regression is performed in order to study more deeply the overall trend of our study between chosen periods. If there is a short term "Empowering Effect", the short term change in number of pageviews after the interruption should be more positive for the treatment group than for the control. If there is a long term "Empowering Effect", the change in the slope of the regression after the interruption should be more positive for the treatment group than for the control. From that and the confidence intervals, it should be possible to assess if we can observe with confidence an "Empowering Effect".

            <p>
                To correct for the radically different number of pageviews across article groups, the pageviews per month are normalized by the mean of the distribution. The normalization should not be dependent on the difference of noise between the data sets and therefore it is not normalized by the maximum value.

                        <p>
                            The comparison between the linear regression on the popular articles and the one on the climate change related articles doesn’t seem to indicate clearly an "Empowering Effect". The long term effect is basically non-existent, indeed the slope of the number of views for both corpus is close to zero in the last period. A short term effect might possibly be argued at the last interruption, since a positive jump is observed in the number of pageviews of the climate change related articles and a negative jump is observed in the corpus featuring the popular articles. The strong negative jump in the corpus featuring the popular articles at the first interruption is also observable but can easily be attributed to noise, which is omnipresent on this set.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The popular articles dataset is quite noisy from the computed R-squared value. Indeed, the optimal linear regression has R-squared equal to 0.499. The fit does not explain a large amount of the set’s variance.

                    <p>
                        The linear regressions and their confidence intervals overlap heavily especially in the first and last periods. It is a good thing that they overlap in the first period because it means that both corpus are similar enough before the treatment appears. That they overlap so much in the last period would be consistent with the claim that there was no long term "Empowering Effect" in this case.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No immediate change can be observed at the interruptions. The confidence intervals overlap quite a bit and it is difficult to assess a long term effect.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is worth noting here that the R-squared value of both linear regressions are similar, suggesting that the quality of the fits is comparable. This is also due to the fact that the variance in both sets is comparable.

                    It seems far fetched to interpret the linear regression comparison between the popular articles and the climate change related articles for the first study case. Even though a short term effect is not excluded at the last interruption, it is confirmed neither by the other interruptions (where the jump simply doesn’t appear) nor by the other data set where we effectively observe no difference between the datasets. It seems that this jump could be an artefact created by the noise in the popular articles dataset. In the case of the scientific corpus of articles, it is not possible to assess any long term "Empowering Effect" with confidence. In fact, both datasets almost appear to be the same in the linear regression and cannot be distinguished with any degree of reasonable confidence. This seems to imply that there is no significant increase in readings of scientific articles that are related to climate change.
