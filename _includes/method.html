            The period of analysis is between January 2018 and February 2020. As seen in HW1, the Covid-19 pandemic influences the pageviews a lot and we will therefore not elongate this analysis onto 2020."
            titre2: "Data selection"
            text2: In the publication, the terrorism articles are compared to another quasi-control group. This group is made or security related articles that would arguably not be affected by the treatment but are similar enough in terms of topic to be used as a control group. The following cells present an attempt at the replication of that method. To be able to reproduce this method in our context, we need a group of articles that are likely to be affected by the treatment, namely that people would consult them more because of the mediatic movement around Greta Thunberg and climate change. The second group should be a group of articles that are similar to the first group such that any external bias would appear in both and therefore cancel out at comparison. It should also not be affected by the treatment, namely not be related to climate change issues. It is not straight forward to find a second group that would be used along with the first corpus that we considered, the corpus of the climate change related articles plotted above because this group is already quite broad. To paliate to this problem, we restrained ourselves to scientific articles chosen in wikipedia index of articles randomly. The first group was selected randomly in a list of scientific articles on topics likely to be related to climate change (biodiversity, energy, meteo, pesticides, earth). The second group was selected randomly in a list of scientific articles on topics not related to climate change (anatomy, genetics, optics, philosophy, social). This pick has the advantage of showing if the public reads on scientific articles, which would confirm the hypothesis that people were encouraged to get educated on the topic of climate change. In the end, we have 4 groups â€“ two different treatment groups that will be compared to 2 different comparators separately. It is anticipated that the list of scientific articles likely to be related to climate change will contain some articles that are not climate change related but in the interest of keeping the choice of the articles arbitrary and therefore as low biased as possible, they will not be handpicked to remove those articles.
