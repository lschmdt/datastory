    title: "Introduction"
    text: "The goal of this work is to observe if the public action of Greta Thunberg and her continual incitation for people to educate themselves on the subject of climate change has actually made a difference. This effect would be diametrically different from a chilling effect in that it pushes people to get educated on a subject, effectively arguably increasing their levels of freedom. This effect shall henceforth be called an Empowering effect. "
